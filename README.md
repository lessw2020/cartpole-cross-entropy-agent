# cartpole-cross-entropy-agent
Pytorch cross entropy RL agent for solving Cartpole.  This code is mostly from Maxim Lapan's outstanding book "Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands On".
Changes - I switched to using AMSgrad for the optimizer and that boosts learning by 30%, and adjusted some of the hyperparameters from the base implementation for faster learning.
